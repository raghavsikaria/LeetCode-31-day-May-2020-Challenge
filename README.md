# My adventure with the viral LeetCode Monthly - Code Everyday Challenge - May'20 Edition

So one fine day(30st April 2020), I casually open LinkedIn _and_ my feed is filled with posts from people who have completed some **LeetCode April 30 Day Challenge** which was made viral by [Akshay Saini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshaymarch7/). The more such posts I saw, the more it intrigued me. I was alot into Competitive Coding in my college days(back till '17) and coded mostly on Hackerrank ([my profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/the_piranha?hr_r=1)) eventually making it into top 300 globally (Problem Solving/Algorithm Practice domain). And now, after 2+ years of corporate monotony, my rusty self recalls this now modified famous quote from someone:

> Coding/Algorithm problem solving is like brushing, and if you don't brush daily - you know what happens! --anonymous

I jumped at this opportunity hoping to get that algorithmic mojo back, and in this repository as Akshay suggested fellow developers on LinkedIn to actively maintain a repo of all solutions, I am maintaining all of my submissions from the challenge.

Hope it's of use to anyone out there!
